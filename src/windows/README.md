# Windows

Windows is fully supported by Topgrade. You may elect to install it from Scoop or use the binary in the release page.
It is important to note that Topgrade may be unable to upgrade certain applications used for launching it, including third-party terminals like cmder.

We suggest either creating a shortcut for 'topgrade--keep' or running Topgrade via your preferred shell.

Please note that if installed via **scoop**, Topgrade may fail to upgrade itself unless `self_rename = true` is set in **topgrade.toml**.
